## INPUTS
This folder contains input (INCAR and KPOINTS) files for geometry optimization computations by VASP.

## OUTPUTS
This folder contains the H-adsorption free energy in eV and .xlsx format (energy.xslx) and structures (CONTCAR) of all slabs (with and without H adsorption) considered in this work. You could find the corresponding structure listed in energy.xslx with the same name.

     GGA  =     RP     !
  NWRITE  =      2     ! (Default: 2) This tag determines how much will be written to the file OUTCAR ('verbosity tag')
  ISTART  =      0     ! (0 from scratch | 1 continuation job | 2 | 3 ) ISTART determines whether or not to read the WAVECAR file.
# ICHARG  =      2     ! (0 from initial WF | 1 Read from CHGCAR | 2 superposition of atomic charge densities | and more ) 
                       ! ICHARG determines how VASP constructs the initial charge density.
  LCHARG  =      F     ! (T yes | F no) determines whether the charge densities (files CHGCAR and CHG) are written.
  LWAVE   =      F     ! (T yes | F no) determines whether the wavefunctions are written to the WAVECAR file at the end of a run.
  LELF    =      F     ! (T yes | F no) determines whether to create an ELFCAR (electron localization function) file or not.

## Parallel computing
#####################

  LPLANE  =      T     ! (T for most cases | F you are available to LOTS OF CORES) LPLANE switches on the plane-wise data distribution in real space.
  NPAR    =      6     ! (sqrt(number of cores) you use) NPAR determines the number of bands that are treated in parallel.
  LSCALU  =      F     ! (F recommended by VASP) LSCALU switches on the parallel LU decomposition (using scaLAPACK) in the orthonormalization of the wave functions.
  NSIM    =      4     ! (4 recommended by VASP) NSIM sets the number of bands that are optimized simultaneously by the RMM-DIIS algorithm.

## Electronic setting
#####################

  ALGO    =   Fast     ! (Normal | VeryFast | Fast | and more) specify the electronic minimization algorithm
  ISPIN   =      2     ! (1 non-spin-polarized | spin-polarized) ISPIN specifies spin polarization.
# MAGMOM  =            ! (NIONS * 1.0	for ISPIN=2)
                       ! MAGMOM Specifies the initial magnetic moment for each atom, if and only if ICHARG=2, or if ICHARG=1 and the CHGCAR file contains no magnetisation density
  ENCUT   =  380.0     ! (1.3*ENMAX recommended) ENCUT specifies the cutoff energy for the plane-wave-basis set in eV.
  NELMIN  =      4     ! sets the minimum number of electronic self-consistency steps
  NELM    =     50     ! sets the maximum number of electronic self-consistency steps
  EDIFF   =  1E-05     ! specifies the global break condition for the electronic SC-loop, in units of eV.
  ISMEAR  =      1     ! (ISMEAR=0, SIGMA=0.03-0.05 for insulator/semiconductor | ISMEAR=1, SIGMA=0.2 for metal | ISMEAR=-5 for DOS)
  SIGMA   =    0.2     ! ISMEAR determines how the partial occupancies fnk are set for each orbital. SIGMA determines the width of the smearing in eV.
# NBANDS  =            ! (max(NELECT/2+NIONS/2,NELECT*0.6)) specifies the total number of KS or QP orbitals in the calculation.

# More technical stuff
  LDIAG   =      T     ! (T | F) determines whether a subspace diagonalization is performed or not within the main algorithm selected by ALGO or IALGO.
  LREAL   =      F     ! (F reciprocal space | A Auto) determines whether the projection operators are evaluated in real-space or in reciprocal space.
  PREC    = Accurate   ! (Normal | Accurate | and more) specifies the "precision"-mode: ENCUT, NGX,Y,Z, NGXF,YF,ZF,ROPT

  IBRION  =      2     ! (0 MD | 1 quasi-Newton | 2 CG | 3 damped MD | 5,6 FD Hessian | 7,8 DFPT Hessian | 44 Dimer method)
                       ! determines how the ions are updated and moved.
  ISIF    =      0     ! (0 only atomic | 7 atomic + volume | and more )
                       ! ISIF determines whether the stress tensor is calculated and which principal degrees-of-freedom are allowed to change in relaxation and molecular dynamics runs.
  NSW     =    500     ! sets the maximum number of ionic steps. 
  EDIFFG  =  -0.02     ! (below 0.02 recommended, minus is to specify force as criteria) defines the break condition for the ionic relaxation loop in eV/A.

  LORBIT  =     11     ! RWIGS tag ignored, DOSCAR and lm-decomposed PROCAR.

# IBAND  =       6     ! Controls which bands are used in the calculation of Band decomposed charge densities. Check also NBMOD and EINT.

Regular k-point mesh   ! Title, not important
0                      ! (0  automatic | N user-specified number) specifies the number of k-points
Gamma                  ! generate a Gamma centered mesh
7  7  1                ! (at least 1/a/0.02, where a is lattice constant) subdivisions N_1, N_2 and N_3 along the reciprocal lattice vectors
0  0  0                ! optional shift of the mesh (s_1, s_2, s_3)
